Within this chapter, the theoretical foundations of the thesis at hand are elucidated. At the beginning, the term business model and various points of view in regards to business models are explained. Furthermore, one business model conceptualization which is used throughout this thesis is described at the end of this section in detail. Afterwards, the \ac{PaaS} domain, relations to other cloud computing components, as well as cloud computing itself are introduced.

\subsection{Origins and Definitions}

Already 1954 Peter F. Drucker proposed the five following questions in order to describe basic business strategies \citep[pp. 49-61]{Drucker1954}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is our business?
	\item Who is the customer?
	\item What is value to the customer?
	\item What will our business be?
	\item What should it be?
\end{enumerate}

However, the term business model itself evolved noticeable within academic journals as late as during the nineties \mycite{Osterwalder2005}{pp. 3-4}{Zott2011}{p. 1022}. As of this writing this paper at hand, there is no generally accepted definition or uniform picture about this concept. According to \citet[p. 726]{Morris2005} and \citet[p. 1022]{Zott2011}, the term business models (at a meta level) has been referred to as an architecture, an assumption, a conceptual tool or model, a description, a design, a framework, a method, a pattern, a plan, a representation, a set, a statement, as well as a structural template. Therefore, a couple of widely used definitions with different points of view are presented below:
	
\begin{quote}{\slshape

Most of the previously mentioned definitions of the term respectively concept business model emphasize to abstract the complexity how a company does business through the concentration on the core elements and their interdependencies. The business model is further often referred to as blueprint \mycite{Osterwalder2005}{p. 2}{Johnson2008}{p. 52}. The blueprint itself represents a simplified representation and qualifies, according to \citet[pp. 11-14]{Osterwalder2005}, to capture, visualize, understand, communicate, and share a company's business logic. Especially, for the purpose of communicating and sharing business models, a common framework or language among all stakeholders is essential to avoid misunderstandings of any kind.

The two aspects value creation and value capture are further terminologies widely used within the business model literature \mycite{Zott2011}{pp. 1019-1020}{Chesbrough2007}{p. 12}. Both parts are reflected in many business model definitions and conceptualizations, explicit as well as implicit. \citet[pp. 729-732]{Morris2005} identifies, in alignment with \citet[pp. 49-61]{Drucker1954}, six key questions concerning basic business model components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How will the firm create value?
	\item For whom will the firm create value?
	\item What is the firm's internal source of advantage?
	\item How will the firm position itself in the marketplace?
	\item How will the firm make money?
	\item What are the entrepreneur's time, scope, and size ambitions?
\end{enumerate}

Even though the concept of business models moves towards a more mature state, just a few enterprises are able to capture their current business model in a holistic view -- including strengths and weaknesses as well as interdependencies \citep[p. 52]{Johnson2008}. This lack of knowledge represents a critical competitive factor, due to the fact that the underlying business model is not less important than the product or technology itself, in some cases even the basis for success or failure \mycite{Chesbrough2007}{p. 12}{Johnson2008}{p. 52}. According to \citet[p. 50]{Johnson2008}, "One secret to maintaining a thriving business is recognizing when it needs a fundamental change." Among others, they described the need for a fundamental business model adjustment experienced by Hilti, a Lichtenstein-based manufacturer of high-end power tools \citep[pp. 54-57]{Johnson2008}. In the past, Hilti was selling its power tools to contractors, however facing an intensified competition and pressure on margins, for instance with low-end power tools manufacturers. For this reason, Hilti decided to change their business model from scratch in such a way that Hilti is now selling the use of its power tools for a monthly fee instead of the power tools itself.

\subsection{Conceptualization}\label{ch:sota:bmc}

Based on an analysis of definitions for business models in literature, the definition of \citet{Johnson2008} was taken as a basis for the research presented in this paper. According to \citet[p. 52]{Johnson2008}, "A business model \ldots consists of four interlocking elements that, taken together, create and deliver value". These four elements are denoted as follows: \ac{CVP}, Profit Formula, Key Resources and Key Processes. In the following, these four elements are described in detail, shortly compared with the Business Model Canvas \citep{Osterwalder2010}, as well as discussed, why the conceptualization by \citet{Johnson2008} is used for the thesis at hand.

The \ac{CVP} is considered as the most crucial part based on its main objective to satisfy customer needs. In order to understand the customer needs, the following key questions should be answered: Who are my target customers?, What is their job to be done (problem)?, and How can their problems be solved (offering)? The interrelation between the job to be done and the corresponding offer as well as the value of the \ac{CVP} are described by  \citet[p. 52]{Johnson2008} in the following way, "The more important the job is to the customer, the lower the level of customer satisfaction with current options for getting the job done, and the better your solution is than existing alternatives at getting the job done (and, of course, the lower the price), the greater the CVP."'

How a company is capturing value for itself based on the offering to its customers is another key element within each business model -- named here as profit formula, consisting of the sub-elements revenue model, cost structure, margin model, and resource velocity.

Assets which are essential to create and deliver the above described \ac{CVP} are summarized as key resources. According to \citet[p. 53]{Johnson2008}, these key resources include people, technology, products, facilities, equipment, channels, as well as the company's brand respectively reputation.

Processes in combination with the assets (key resources) are necessary to deliver the value proposition to the company's customers. These processes need to be efficient, repeatable, and scalable. Key processes include repeating operations -- training, development, manufacturing, budgeting, planning, sales, and services -- as well as the company's rules, metrics, and norms \citep[p. 53]{Johnson2008}.

In summary, within the business model conceptualization proposed by \citet[p. 54]{Johnson2008} the \ac{CVP} and the profit formula encompass the value description for both parties, the target customers as well as the company itself. The value creation and delivery is explained by the two business model elements key resources and key processes. In Table \ref{bm:concept} the business model conceptualization is graphical depicted.

\input{businessModels/bm_concept}

Another well-known business model conceptualization respectively framework is the Business Model Canvas introduced by \citet{Osterwalder2010}. This framework consists of nine the so-called business model building blocks -- namely (1) Value Propositions, (2) Customer Segments, (3) Channels, (4) Customer Relationships, (5) Key Activities, (6) Key Resources, (7) Key Partners, (8) Cost Structure, and (9) Revenue Streams. Please find the proposed representation scheme in the Appendix \ref{ch:app02} (cf. Figure \ref{fig:bmc}). In simplified terms, the bottom part of the Business Model Canvas -- Cost Structure and Revenue Streams -- deals with the value capture aspect or, in other words, why a company should perform (or is performing) the described business model. The remaining seven building blocks -- Value Propositions, Customer Segments, Channels, Customer Relationships, Key Activities, Key Resources, and Key Partners -- are representing the value creation aspect. Whereas the upper left side answers the how-, the center part (Value Propositions) the what-, and the right side the who-question. Although the business model conceptualizations by \citet{Johnson2008} and \citet{Osterwalder2010} differ in the total number of defined business model elements, they can be easily compared. In the following Table \ref{tab:bmcc}, the business model elements according to \citet{Johnson2008} and \citet{Osterwalder2010} are opposed.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lp{.4\textwidth}}
			\citet{Johnson2008} & \citet{Osterwalder2010}\\ \hline
			\ac{CVP}	& Customer Segments \newline Value Propositions\\ \hline
			Profit Formula	& Cost Structure \newline	Revenue Streams\\ \hline
			Key Resources	& Key Resources \newline Key Partners \newline Channels\\ \hline
			Key Processes	& Key Activities \newline	Customer Relationships
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Business Model Conceptualization Comparison}
	\label{tab:bmcc}
\end{table}

Platform-based business models are by nature two-sided or even multi-sided business models -- in respect of the customer segments and the corresponding value proposition. Whereas the Business Model Canvas is appropriate to utilize for one-sided business models, in the domain of platform-based business models one major shortcoming restricts its utilization. In terms of \citet{Johnson2008}, each customer segments has its own problem (job to de done) and needs a corresponding offering (value proposition). Thus, it is crucial to differentiate between different customer segments in platform-based business models. The Business Model Canvas framework cannot easily be extended (the upper center and right side -- especially the two elements Value Proposition and Customer Segments) to take into account several disjoint customer segments and their corresponding value proposition. While the framework proposed by \citet{Johnson2008} can easily consider more than one customer segment, due to the fact that several \acp{CVP} -- including the customer segment (target customer) and their value proposition (offering) -- are possible.
