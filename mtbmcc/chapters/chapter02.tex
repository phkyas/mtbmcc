Within this chapter, the theoretical foundations of the thesis at hand are elucidated. At the beginning, the term business model and various points of view in regards to business models are explained. Furthermore, one business model conceptualization which is used throughout this thesis is described at the end of this section in detail. Afterwards, the \ac{PaaS} domain, relations to other cloud computing components, as well as cloud computing itself are introduced.

\subsection{Origins and Definitions}

Already 1954 Peter F. Drucker proposed the five following questions in order to describe basic business strategies \citep[pp. 49-61]{Drucker1954}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is our business?
	\item Who is the customer?
	\item What is value to the customer?
	\item What will our business be?
	\item What should it be?
\end{enumerate}

However, the term business model itself evolved noticeable within academic journals as late as during the nineties \mycite{Osterwalder2005}{pp. 3-4}{Zott2011}{p. 1022}. As of writing this paper at hand, there is no generally accepted definition or uniform picture about this concept. According to \citet[p. 726]{Morris2005} and \citet[p. 1022]{Zott2011}, the term business models (at a meta level) has been referred to as an architecture, an assumption, a conceptual tool or model, a description, a design, a framework, a method, a pattern, a plan, a representation, a set, a statement, as well as a structural template. Therefore, a couple of widely used definitions with different points of view are presented below:
	
\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"[A business model is] an architecture for the product, service and information flows, including a description of the various business actors and their roles; and a description of the potential benefits for the various business actors; and a description of the sources of revenues."}

\end{quote}

Most of the previously mentioned definitions of the term respectively concept business model emphasize to abstract the complexity how a company does business through the concentration on the core elements and their interdependencies. The business model is further often referred to as blueprint \mycite{Osterwalder2005}{p. 2}{Johnson2008}{p. 52}. The blueprint itself represents a simplified representation and qualifies, according to \citet[pp. 11-14]{Osterwalder2005}, to capture, visualize, understand, communicate, and share a company's business logic. Especially, for the purpose of communicating and sharing business models, a common framework or language among all stakeholders is essential to avoid misunderstandings of any kind.

The two aspects value creation and value capture are further terminologies widely used within the business model literature \mycite{Chesbrough2007}{p. 12}{Zott2011}{pp. 1019-1020}. Both parts are reflected in many business model definitions and conceptualizations, explicit as well as implicit. \citet[pp. 729-732]{Morris2005} identified, in alignment with \citet[pp. 49-61]{Drucker1954}, six key questions concerning basic business model components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How will the firm create value?
	\item For whom will the firm create value?
	\item What is the firm's internal source of advantage?
	\item How will the firm position itself in the marketplace?
	\item How will the firm make money?
	\item What are the entrepreneur's time, scope, and size ambitions?
\end{enumerate}

Even though the concept of business models moves towards a more mature state, just a few enterprises are able to capture their current business model in a holistic view -- including strengths and weaknesses as well as interdependencies \citep[p. 52]{Johnson2008}. This lack of knowledge represents a critical competitive factor, due to the fact that the underlying business model is not less important than the product or technology itself, in some cases even the basis for success or failure \mycite{Chesbrough2007}{p. 12}{Johnson2008}{p. 52}. According to \citet[p. 50]{Johnson2008}, \textit{"One secret to maintaining a thriving business is recognizing when it needs a fundamental change."} Among others, they described the need for a fundamental business model adjustment experienced by Hilti, a Lichtenstein-based manufacturer of high-end power tools \citep[pp. 54-57]{Johnson2008}. In the past, Hilti was selling its power tools to contractors, however facing an intensified competition and pressure on margins, for instance with low-end power tools manufacturers. For this reason, Hilti decided to change their business model from scratch in such a way that Hilti is now selling the use of its power tools for a monthly fee instead of the power tools itself.

\subsection{Conceptualization}\label{ch:sota:bmc}

Based on an analysis of definitions for business models in literature, the definition of \citet{Johnson2008} was taken as a basis for the research presented in this paper. According to \citet[p. 52]{Johnson2008}, \textit{"A business model \ldots consists of four interlocking elements that, taken together, create and deliver value"}. These four elements are denoted as follows: \ac{CVP}, profit formula, key resources and key processes. In the following, these four elements are described in detail, shortly compared with the Business Model Canvas \citep{Osterwalder2010}, as well as discussed why the conceptualization by \citet{Johnson2008} is used for the thesis at hand.

The \ac{CVP} is considered as the most crucial part based on its main objective to satisfy customer needs. In order to understand the customer needs, the following key questions should be answered: Who are my target customers?, What is their job to be done (problem)?, and How can their problems be solved (offering)? The interrelation between the job to be done and the corresponding offer as well as the value of the \ac{CVP} are described by  \citet[p. 52]{Johnson2008} in the following way, \textit{"The more important the job is to the customer, the lower the level of customer satisfaction with current options for getting the job done, and the better your solution is than existing alternatives at getting the job done (and, of course, the lower the price), the greater the CVP."}

How a company is capturing value for itself based on the offering to its customers is another key element within each business model -- named here as profit formula, consisting of the sub-elements revenue model, cost structure, margin model, and resource velocity.

Assets which are essential to create and deliver the above described \ac{CVP} are summarized as key resources. According to \citet[p. 53]{Johnson2008}, these key resources include people, technology, products, facilities, equipment, channels, as well as the company's brand respectively reputation.

Processes in combination with the assets (key resources) are necessary to deliver the value proposition to the company's customers. These processes need to be efficient, repeatable, and scalable. Key processes include repeating operations -- training, development, manufacturing, budgeting, planning, sales, and services -- as well as the company's rules, metrics, and norms \citep[p. 53]{Johnson2008}.

In summary, within the business model conceptualization proposed by \citet[p. 54]{Johnson2008} the \ac{CVP} and the profit formula encompass the value description for both parties, the target customers as well as the company itself. The value creation and delivery is explained by the two business model elements key resources and key processes. In Table \ref{bm:concept} the business model conceptualization is graphical depicted:

\input{businessModels/bm_concept}

Another well-known business model conceptualization respectively framework is the Business Model Canvas introduced by \citet{Osterwalder2010}. This framework consists of nine the so-called business model building blocks -- namely (1) value propositions, (2) customer segments, (3) channels, (4) customer relationships, (5) key activities, (6) key resources, (7) key partners, (8) cost structure, and (9) revenue streams. Please find the proposed representation scheme in the Appendix \ref{ch:app02} (cf. Figure \ref{fig:bmc}). In simplified terms, the bottom part of the Business Model Canvas -- cost structure and revenue streams -- deals with the value capture aspect or, in other words, why a company should perform (or is performing) the described business model. The remaining seven building blocks -- value propositions, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, key activities, key resources, and key partners -- are representing the value creation aspect. Whereas the upper left side answers the how-, the center part (value propositions) the what-, and the right side the who-question. Although the business model conceptualizations by \citet{Johnson2008} and \citet{Osterwalder2010} differ in the total number of defined business model elements, they can be easily compared. In the following Table \ref{tab:bmcc}, the business model elements according to \citet{Johnson2008} and \citet{Osterwalder2010} are opposed:

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lp{.4\textwidth}}
			\citet{Johnson2008} & \citet{Osterwalder2010}\\ \hline
			\ac{CVP}	& Customer Segments \newline Value Propositions\\ \hline
			Profit Formula	& Cost Structure \newline	Revenue Streams\\ \hline
			Key Resources	& Key Resources \newline Key Partners \newline Channels\\ \hline
			Key Processes	& Key Activities \newline	Customer Relationships
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Business Model Conceptualization Comparison}
	\label{tab:bmcc}
\end{table}

Platform-based business models are by nature two-sided or even multi-sided business models -- in respect of the customer segments and the corresponding value propositions. Whereas the Business Model Canvas is appropriate to utilize for one-sided business models, in the domain of platform-based business models one major shortcoming restricts its utilization. In terms of \citet{Johnson2008}, each customer segment has its own problem (job to de done) and needs a corresponding offering (value proposition). Thus, it is crucial to differentiate between different customer segments in platform-based business models. The Business Model Canvas framework cannot easily be extended (the upper center and right side -- especially the two elements value proposition and customer segments) to take into account several disjoint customer segments and their corresponding value propositions. While the framework proposed by \citet{Johnson2008} can easily consider more than one customer segment, due to the fact that several \acp{CVP} -- including the customer segment (target customer) and their value proposition (offering) -- are possible.

\subsection{Terminology}

In the recent past, a new computing paradigm in the IT industry has emerged -- cloud computing or also referred to as computing as a utility. Due to the fact that cloud computing is still maturing, there is up to this point no general accepted definition or even standardization, although a considerable amount of academic and applied research has been published. A well-established and widely used definition is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), despite its general and broad character:

\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction."}
\vspace*{-7pt}
\begin{flushright}
	--- \citet[p. 2]{Mell2011}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

Based on a comprehensive literature review of current cloud computing definitions, \citet{Vaquero2009} identified ten essential cloud characteristics -- user friendliness, virtualization, internet centric, variety of resources, automatic adaptation, scalability, resource optimization, pay per use, service \acp{SLA}, and infrastructure \acp{SLA}. Not all of these characteristics are used throughout all the investigated definitions, however, a few of them are widely accepted and led \citet{Vaquero2009} derive a minimal cloud computing definition, encompassing \textit{"scalability, pay-per-use utility model and virtualization"} \citep[p. 51]{Vaquero2009}. Besides this minimal definition, a more comprehensive consensus definition has been extracted:

\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"Clouds are a large pool of easily usable and accessible virtualized resources (such as hardware, development platforms and/or services). These resources can be dynamically reconfigured to adjust to a variable load (scale), allowing also for an optimum resource utilization. This
pool of resources is typically exploited by a pay-per-use model in which guarantees are offered by the Infrastructure Provider by means of customized \acp{SLA}."}
\vspace*{-7pt}
\begin{flushright}
	--- \citet[p. 51]{Vaquero2009}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

Inherent in the concept of cloud computing are three layers (\citealp[pp. 118-119]{Iyer2010} and \citealp[pp. 2-3]{Mell2011}) -- also referred to as cloud stack (cf. Figure \ref{fig:ccs}). 

The \ac{SaaS} layer is the most visible layer of cloud computing for end users, since they access here the provided on-demand applications, without the need to manage or control the underlying infrastructure. Next, the \ac{PaaS} layer enables to develop and deploy applications as well as services onto cloud infrastructure. Finally, the \ac{IaaS} layer encompasses the provision of various computing resources, for instance, processing, storage, and network. In contrast to \citet[p.50]{Armbrust2010}, in this thesis the \ac{IaaS} as well as \ac{PaaS} layer considered as two different concepts, and not as similar or indiscernible ones. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\input{gfx/cloudStack}
	\caption{Cloud Computing Stack}
	\label{fig:ccs}
\end{figure}

According to \citet[p. 3]{Mell2011}, four development models are commonly used. First, private clouds are solely for a dedicated entity and managed by the entity itself or a third-party. Second, several entities operate together a community cloud to support a shared goal or mission. Third, public clouds are owned by an organization and open to general public or a dedicated domain. And fourth, any combination of two or more the above mentioned clouds is denoted as a hybrid cloud.

Several authors have identified a number of features of the domain cloud computing, which are listed below to provide a broad overview. \citet[pp. 54-58]{Armbrust2010} identified ten obstacles for cloud computing -- three concerning the adaption (availability/business continuity, data lock-in, data confidentiality and auditability), the next five affecting the growth (data transfer bottlenecks, performance unpredictability, scalable storage, bugs in large distributed systems, and scaling quickly), and the last two are business obstacles (reputation fate sharing and software licensing). \citet[pp. 120-127]{Iyer2010} described seven cloud computing capabilities -- controlled interface, location independence, sourcing independence, ubiquitous access, virtual business environments, addressability and traceability, and rapid elasticity. And finally, \citet[p. 2]{Mell2011} highlighted five essential characteristics in this field -- on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measure service. 

\citet{Smith2012} analyzed the cloud computing environment and reasoned that cloud computing with its various sub-concepts, like \ac{IaaS}, \ac{PaaS}, and \ac{SaaS}, is still an evolving area. However, the individual sub-concepts are at different stages of development. According to \citet[p. 5]{Smith2012}, the \ac{IaaS} and especially the \ac{SaaS} layer are already quite mature and will reach the so-called plateau of productivity in the near future. Whereas the \ac{PaaS} layer is currently at the labeled peak of inflated expectations and further research is necessary to determine the actually capabilities of this layer. Please find the complete picture of this study within Appendix \ref{ch:app03} (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cloudCycle}). Also \citet[p. 120]{Iyer2010} identified that the cloud computing area is still maturing, while the \ac{IaaS} layer is the prevalent sub-concept.

Cloud computing is especially for \acp{SME} beneficial, based on limited IT in-house resources and knowledge associated with growing IT requirements and needs (\citealp[p. 398]{Weinhardt2009} and \citealp{Karabek2011}). Benefits inherent in cloud computing, regardless of the customer size, are an increased flexibility, reliability, as well as agility to respond to internal and external demands (\citealp[p. 51]{Vaquero2009} and \citealp[p. 129]{Iyer2010}). Moreover, the first steps into cloud computing are not accompanied by high entry costs or upfront investment costs and the use of cloud computing enables companies to convert capital expenses to operating expenses (CapEx to OpEx), or, in other words, to convert fixed costs into variable costs, hence gaining the possibility to focus on their core business \citep[pp. 51-53]{Armbrust2010}. At the current state, most of the cloud computing offers are not priced based on the classical license agreements, rather on a usage-based pricing, labeled as pay as you go or pay for use pricing (\citealp[pp. 50-54]{Vaquero2009}; \citealp[pp. 51-53,58]{Armbrust2010}; and \citealp[p. 2]{Iyer2010}). A comprehensive overview about pricing strategies of software vendors is provided by \citet{Lehmann2009}.

\end{figure}

One of the key features of cloud computing and its sub-concepts is the ability to scale according to the required demand, also referred to as elasticity (\citealp{Armbrust2010}; \citealp{Iyer2010}; and \citealp{Mell2011}). In order to provide a flexible utilization of resources, cloud providers use the concepts of virtualization and statistical multiplexing. By using these functionalities, a cloud service can scale up as well as scale down nearly in real-time, hereby allocate enough resources to cope with dynamic workloads (cf. Figure \ref{fig:rpc}). In contrast to cloud services, static on-premise systems cannot easily scale dynamically and by no means in real-time. For this kind of systems a managerial decision about the expected peak load is required to determine the computing capacity necessary to perform the peak load. Two common cases, both suboptimal, are typical in this kind of situation. First, the peak load is underestimated and consequently the available computing capacity is not capable to handle the actual peak loads (cf. Figure \ref{fig:rpu}). And second, the peak load is overestimated and hence a large part of the computing resources are always idle, in other words, the available resources are underutilized (cf. Figure \ref{fig:rpo}). Undoubtedly, these two cases represent risks for companies -- either systems with a high response times or a waste of money. The utilization of cloud services enables companies to shift these risks largely to the cloud provider and by this means staying able to act in a flexible manner.



\subsection{Platform as a Service}

For a better understanding of platforms and the \ac{PaaS} layer, in the following a few more definitions are provided. These insights might be helpful in the sequel of this thesis. Product platforms are general defined by \citet{Halman2003} as follows:

\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"A platform \ldots is neither the same as an individual product, nor is it the same as a product family; it is the common basis of all individual products within a product family. \ldots The leading principle behind the platform concept is to balance the commonality potential and differentiation needs within a product family. \ldots [Therefore, product platforms are considered] as a set of subsystems and interfaces that form a common structure from which a stream of related products can be developed and produced efficiently."}
\vspace*{-7pt}
\begin{flushright}
	--- \citet[pp. 150-151]{Halman2003}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

Within the IT industry many (technical) platforms are prevalent -- for instance operating system platforms. \citet{Beimborn2011} defined platforms within the IT industry in the following way:

\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"[Platforms] refer to a hardware configuration, an operating system, a software framework or any other common entity on which a number of associated components or services run."}
\vspace*{-7pt}
\begin{flushright}
	--- \citet[p. 88]{Beimborn2011}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

Based on the above mentioned introductory platform definitions, hereafter two definitions dedicated to platforms within the area of cloud computing, also known as \ac{PaaS} layer, are listed below:

\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"[The \ac{PaaS} layer] provides a higher level of abstraction that allows developers to build applications without worrying about computer processes. Typically, vendors such as Google and Salesforce.com provide a development environment with a programming language that can be used to create new applications."}
\vspace*{-7pt}
\begin{flushright}
	--- \citet[p. 118]{Iyer2010}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}{\slshape 
"The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. [Footnote in the original source: This capability does not necessarily preclude the use of compatible programming languages, libraries, services, and tools from other sources.] The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment."}
\vspace*{-7pt}
\begin{flushright}
	--- \citet[p. 2-3]{Mell2011}
\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

In simplified terms, the \ac{PaaS} layer abstracts the \ac{IaaS} layer (inclusive the automated resource management) and provides a runtime environment where applications and services run on. Usually, these software platforms are open to external developers and offer a kind of development environment, either online (i.e. browser-based) or offline (i.e. \ac{SDK}), sometimes even both variants are provided. Furthermore, these development environments address different stakeholders, ranging from technical developers to business people, and thus vary from comprehensive \acp{IDE} to graphical drag and drop environments. A powerful dashboard -- including features to administrate and manage application as well as service related issues -- completes commonly the \ac{PaaS} offer.
As mentioned earlier already, according to \citet[p. 5]{Smith2012} the \ac{PaaS} layer is currently located at the so-called peak of inflated expectations (cf. Appendix \ref{ch:app03}) and consequently some of the current \ac{PaaS} providers will be driven out of the market as well as new \ac{PaaS} providers will emerge. Furthermore, it can be expected that the competition between \ac{PaaS} providers will increase constantly. \citet[pp. 117,128-129]{Iyer2010} described those rivalry as ecosystem-based respectively network-based competiton.
