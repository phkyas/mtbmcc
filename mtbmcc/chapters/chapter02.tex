Within this chapter, the theoretical foundations of the thesis at hand are elucidated. At the beginning, the \ac{PaaS} domain, relations to other cloud computing components, as well as cloud computing itself are introduced. Afterwards, the term business model and various points of view in regards to business models are explained. Furthermore, one business model conceptualization which is used throughout this thesis is described at the end of this chapter in detail.

\section{Business Model Conceptualization}\label{ch:sota:bmc}

Based on an analysis of definitions for business models in literature (cf. Section \ref{ch:tf:bm}), the definition of \citet{Johnson2008} was taken as a basis for the research presented in this paper. According to \citet[p. 52]{Johnson2008}, "A business model \ldots consists of four interlocking elements that, taken together, create and deliver value". These four elements are denoted as follows: \ac{CVP}, Profit Formula, Key Resources and Key Processes. 

The \ac{CVP} is considered as the most crucial part based on its main objective to satisfy customer needs. In order to understand the customer needs, the following key questions should be answered: Who are my target customers?, What is their job to be done (problem)?, and How can their problems be solved (offering)? The interrelation between the job to be done and the corresponding offer as well as the value of the \ac{CVP} are described by  \citet[p. 52]{Johnson2008} in the following way, "The more important the job is to the customer, the lower the level of customer satisfaction with current options for getting the job done, and the better your solution is than existing alternatives at getting the job done (and, of course, the lower the price), the greater the CVP."'

How a company is capturing value for itself based on the offering to its customer is another key element within each business model -- named here as profit formula, consisting of the sub elements revenue model, cost structure, margin model, and resource velocity.

Assets which are essential to create and deliver the above described customer value proposition are summarized as key resources. According to \citet[p. 53]{Johnson2008}, these key resources include people, technology, products, facilities, equipment, channels, as well as the company's brand respectively reputation.

Processes in combination with the assets (key resources) are necessary to deliver the value proposition to the company's customers. These processes need to be efficient, repeatable, and scalable. Key processes include repeating operations -- training, development, manufacturing, budgeting, planning, sales, and services -- as well as the company's rules, metrics, and norms \citep[p. 53]{Johnson2008}.

In summary, within the business model conceptualization proposed by \citet[p. 54]{Johnson2008} the customer value proposition and the profit formula encompass the value description for both parties, the target customers as well as the company itself. The value creation and delivery is explained by the two business model elements key resources and key processes. In Table \ref{bm:concept} the business model conceptualization is graphical depicted.

The main focus at all conducted case studies was rather how the business model appears on the market and is experienced by customers than how the business model is implemented by a specific company or to describe the internal view of the business model. For this reason, the market view elements -- the \ac{CVP} and, in parts, the profit formula -- are mainly considered, even though the non-market view elements -- key resources and key processes -- are mentioned as far as possible. Moreover, the focus on market view elements allowed to solely utilize secondary data for the conducted analysis of \ac{PaaS} providers' business models -- for instance reliable, public data or documentations, both providing comprehensive information about the business model under investigation. Information concerning the internal business model elements -- key resources, key processes, and, in parts, the profit formula -- is difficult to obtain, due to the fact, that this information is in most cases kept confidential, for instance, the cost structure as well as process or workflow descriptions. Thus, the following presented business models mainly focus on the market view elements.
