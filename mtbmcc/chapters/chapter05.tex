\chapter{Simulating the Adoption of Platform as a Service Business Models}\label{ch:sfd}
% ****************************************************************************************************

Based on the qualitative model discussed above, in this chapter a quantitative model is developed in order to simulate the adoption of \ac{PaaS} business models. As with the qualitative model, this quantitative model makes use of the concept of system dynamics according to \citet{Sterman2000,Sterman2001}. To be more specific, the overall qualitative model and \ac{CLD} (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_bp}) will be translated into a quantitative model, also known as \acf{SFD}. Thus both the third sub-research question, and the main research question regarding high-leverage interventions and policies for achieving a high adoption rate, are answered.

\section{Stocks and Flows}\label{ch:sfd:sf}
% ****************************************************************************************************

The two central concepts of system dynamics theory are stocks and flows, as well as the feedback structure of the system under investigation. Basically, stocks accumulate flows over time. Moreover, \textit{"they characterize the state of the system and generate the information upon which decisions and actions are based. Stocks give systems inertia and provide them with memory. Stocks create delays by accumulating the difference between the inflow to a process and its outflow. By decoupling rates of flow, stocks are the source of disequilibrium dynamics in system"} \citep[p. 192]{Sterman2000}.

	\label{fig:sfd_b}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:sfd_b} the general structure of stocks and flows is illustrated. A stock increases through one or more inflows. These flows can either come from outside the model, thus representing a model boundary (denoted as cloud), or from another stock. Hence this kind of flow is both an inflow and outflow simultaneously: an outflow for stock A and an inflow for stock B. Through one or more outflows, stocks decrease over time. These outflows can either represent a model boundary (denoted as cloud) or flow into another stock.

The size of a stock at any time is the accumulation of all its inflows minus all its outflows plus the initial stock size. Using mathematical notation this can be stated as follows: stocks integrate their flows. This leads to the following integral equation, following \citet[p. 194]{Sterman2000},

\begin{equation}\label{eq:int}
		Stock(t) = \int\limits_{t_0}^t [Inflow(s) - Outflow(s)]ds + Stock(t_0),
\end{equation}

where $Inflow(s)$ and $Outflow(s)$ represent the flows at any time $s$ between the initial time $t_0$ and the current time $t$, and $Stock(t_0)$ denotes the initial stock size. 

Another quantity of interest is the net rate of change of any stock, which is defined by the following differential equation, following \citet[p. 194]{Sterman2000},

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dif}
		\frac{d(Stock)}{dt} = \mathit{Net~Change~in~Stock} = Inflow(t) - Outflow(t),
\end{equation}

where $Inflow(t)$ and $Ouflow(t)$ represent the flows at the current time $t$. By applying the above described concept of stocks and flows to the previously developed \ac{CLD}, 11 crucial stocks in the domain of \ac{PaaS} business models are revealed (cf. Figure \ref{fig:sfd_cs}). The number of all stakeholders using the platform is denoted as customer base and increases through the inflow of new customers. However, in this study the length of time during which the platform adoption was investigated is quite short. Therefore, the stock customer base does not decrease through a corresponding outflow, which simplifies the \ac{SFD}. The remaining ten stocks are dedicated to the five customer segments defined earlier. Each customer segment is modeled as a stock of potential customers (denoted as potential <customer segment>\footnote{The wildcard \texttt{<customer segment>} represents the five customer segments identified earlier.}) and as a second stock of the customer population (denoted as <customer segment> population). These two stocks are linked through the flow adoption rate <customer segment>, where this flow decreases the stock potential <customer segment> and increases the stock <customer segment> population. As with the stock customer base, the corresponding model boundaries for the ten stocks relating to the five customer segments have been defined. The <customer segment> population stock does not decrease through an outflow due to the short time period considered. This also applies to the stock customer base. The initial value of all five potential <customer segment> stocks is determined before the platform adoption simulation is started. These values do decrease over time through the corresponding outflows. These stocks can be defined in two different ways. Either, the number of potential customers for the five customer segments can be estimated and used for the simulation by analyzing the market opportunities of the platform under investigation. On the other hand, the simulation will produce absolute values. And second, the simulation can be run using relative values ($0\%$ - $100\%$). In contrast to the first case, the simulation result here indicate that at any time $t$, $i\%$ of a customer segment are using the platform (this obviously holds for all customer segments).

	\caption{Stock and Flow Diagram -- Generic PaaS Customer Segment}
	\label{fig:sfd_cs}
\end{figure}

The two flows described above, i.e. new customers and adoption rate <customer segment>, are influenced as follows. The inflow of new customers is the accumulation of the inflows into all five customer segments (cf. Formula \ref{eq:nc}), whereas the adoption rate <customer segment> is the sum of the innovators (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:in}), imitators (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:im}), and the adoption from the customer value proposition (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:acvp}). As mentioned by \citet[p. 20]{Sterman2001}, his elementary adoption cycle (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_ac}) needs to be adapted according to circumstances. Thus, in the quantification process the adoption rate is modeled using this three influences. Using these variables ensures that the diffusion of innovations theory introduced by \citet{Rogers2003} is taken into account. Thereby not only the group of innovators, but also that of early adopters is considered in the simulation of the \ac{PaaS} adoption.

Imitators and the adoption from the customer value proposition are mainly influenced by network effects. For example, imitators are won through existing customers within the same customer segment, thus representing a same-sided network effect (cf. the feedback loops R\_1 and B\_1 in Figure \ref{fig:cld_cs}). In contrast to imitators, 'convinced' adopters (adoption from customer value proposition) start using the platform due to the attractive value proposition, which is partly influenced by other customer segments, thus representing cross-sided network effects (cf. the feedback loops identified in Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}). Figure \ref{fig:sfd_cs} illustrates the generic stock and flow structure for the \ac{PaaS} domain just described.

\section{Model Foundations}\label{ch:sfd:mf}
% ****************************************************************************************************
In the following the foundations of the quantitative model are introduced, which are necessary in order to simulate the platform adoption. Since quite a few acronyms are used in the following pages these are briefly listed in Table \ref{tab:acro} for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility.

\end{table}

As mentioned above, the flow $New~Customers(t)$ is the accumulation of the five customer segment inflows $AR_{CS}(t)$ at any time $t$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nc}
	\mathit{New~Customers(t)} = \sum AR_{CS}(t)
\end{equation}

The corresponding stock $Customer~Base(t)$ is simply the initial stock size $\mathit{Customer~Base(t_0)}$ increased by the inflow $New~Customers(s)$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cb}
	\mathit{Customer~Base(t)} = \int\limits_{t_0}^t \mathit{[New~Customers(s)]ds} + \mathit{Customer~Base(t_0)}
\end{equation}

By using the stock $Customer~Base(t)$, the overall market penetration $MP_{Overall}(t)$ can be calculated. Due to the simplifications in the model, this value is the ratio of the $Customer~Base(t)$ to the sum of all current \linebreak ($Customer~Base(t)$) as well as potential ($Potential~CS(t)$) customers:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:mpo}
	MP_{Overall}(t) = \frac{\mathit{Customer~Base(t)}}{\mathit{Customer~Base(t)} + \sum \mathit{Potential~CS(t)}} \in [0.0,1.0]
\end{equation}

In Section \ref{ch:sfd:mv} and \ref{ch:sfd:mp} the model variables and parameters used in this simulation are introduced. These and other values need to be mapped onto certain intervals so as to adjust the model dynamics. In order to map the values of the function $f(s) \in [a_1,a_2]$ onto the desired interval $[b_1,b_2]$, the following generic linear transformation is used:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lt}
	f(l) = b_{1} + \frac{(s-a_1) \cdot (b_2-b_1)}{(a_2-a_1)} \in [b_1,b_2]
\end{equation}

In the particular case of mapping the function $f(s) \in [0,1]$ onto the interval $[b_1,b_2]$, Formula \ref{eq:lt} can be simplified as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lts}
	f(l) = b_{1} + s \cdot (b_{2}-b_{1}) \in [b_{1},b_{2}].
\end{equation}

For the following five formulas, these two linear transformations, appropriately simplified, are used to map the corresponding functions onto the desired intervals.

During the investigation of \ac{PaaS} business models, the differences between the governance models pursued were noted and considered in the classification scheme and in the \ac{CLD}. In the quantitative model, the value of the governance is considered fixed, due to the short study period and the assumption that \ac{PaaS} providers will not change their governance model from scratch within this time frame. Therefore the initial governance model value $GOV(t_0)$ is simply mapped onto the corresponding interval between the lower boundary $LB_{GOV}$ and upper boundary $UP_{GOV}$ by applying the simplified transformation as shown in Formula \ref{eq:lts}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:gov}
	GOV(t_0) = LB_{GOV} + GOV(t_0) \cdot (UB_{GOV} - LB_{GOV}) \in [LB_{GOV},UB_{GOV}]
\end{equation}

Regarding the overall \ac{CLD}, it was reasoned that an increase in the customer base will increase the revenue above what it would otherwise have been. Furthermore, through the increased revenue the platform investments will increase subsequently, which will ultimately result in increased platform improvements. However, in the \ac{SFD} these facts are simplified for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility. In order to make the quantitative model understandable in spite of its complexity, and to avoid adding too many external variables and assumptions to this model, the value of the variable $MP_{Overall}(t)$ (cf. Formula \ref{eq:mpo}) is simply mapped onto the desired platform improvements interval by applying Formula \ref{eq:lts}. The idea to obtain the variable platform improvements $PI(t)$, which is basically in line with \citet[p. 200]{Evans2003}, was that an increased customer base will ultimately lead to higher platform improvements:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pi}
	PI(t) = LB_{PI} + MP_{Overall}(t) \cdot (UB_{PI} - LB_{PI}) \in [LB_{PI},UB_{PI}]
\end{equation}

The next two general values, i.e. technical scope as well as additional services, are further contributing factors which have been discovered and modeled previously. In contrast to the governance model, these two factors are assumed to improve over time through the variable platform improvements $PI(t)$ as calculated in Formula \ref{eq:pi}. Hence, for any time $t$ the actual value for both is calculated by using the initial value $TS(t_0)$ or $ AS(t_0)$ respectively, and multiplying it by the current platform improvements $PI(t)$. This intermediate value is then mapped onto the desired interval by applying Formula \ref{eq:lt}. Due to the specific intervals for these two variables, the denominator of the Formulas \ref{eq:ts} and \ref{eq:as} is equal to the upper boundary of the platform improvements $UB_{PI}$\footnote{Values for $TS(t_0)$ and $AS(t_0)$ are in the interval $[0.0,1.0]$ and for $PI(t)$ in the interval $[1.0,2.0]$ (cf. Section \ref{ch:sfd:mv} and \ref{ch:sfd:mp}). Thus, the intermediate results ($TS(t_0)*PI(t)$ and $AS(t_0) *PI(t)$) are in the interval $[0.0,2.0]$ which represents the interval $[a_1,a_2]$ from Formula \ref{eq:lt}. Consequently, the denominator for this linear transformation is $2.0$ ($a_2 - a_1 = 2.0 - 0.0 = 2.0$), equals to $UB_{PI}$. This holds as long as $TS(t_0)$ or $AS(t_0)$ are equal to $0$.}:

\begin{align}
	TS(t) &= LB_{TS} +  \frac{(TS(t_0) \cdot PI(t)) \cdot (UB_{TS} - LB_{TS})}{UB_{PI}} \in [LB_{TS},UB_{TS}],\label{eq:ts}\\
	AS(t) &= LB_{AS} +  \frac{(AS(t_0) \cdot PI(t)) \cdot (UB_{AS} - LB_{AS})}{UB_{PI}} \in [LB_{AS},UB_{AS}]\label{eq:as}
\end{align} 

Finally, the variable platform modules, i.e. applications, services, components, and add-ons, represents the last foundation of the model. As mentioned above, platform modules are developed and deployed by complementors, i.e. \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups, and thus the values of the market penetration of these two customer segments ($MP_{ISV}(t)$ cf. Formula \ref{eq:mp:isv}, $MP_{ITS}(t)$ cf. Formula \ref{eq:mp:its}) are used in order to calculate the value of the variable platform modules. This approach was again chosen so as to avoid too many additional assumptions, parameters, variables, and the like. Therefore the two market penetration values are simply added and mapped onto the desired interval by using the linear transformation given in Formula \ref{eq:lt}. In this particular case, the denominator of the Formula \ref{eq:pm} is equal to the sum of $UB_{ISV}$ and $UB_{ITS}$\footnote{Values for $MP_{ISV}(t)$ and $MP_{ITS}(t)$ are in the interval [0.0,1.0] (cf. Section \ref{ch:sfd:mp}). Thus, the addition of $MP_{ISV}(t) + MP_{ITS}(t)$ has results in the interval $[0.0,2.0]$ which represents the interval $[a_1,a_2]$ from Formula \ref{eq:lt}. Consequently, the denominator for this linear transformation is $2.0$ ($a_2 - a_1 = 2.0 - 0.0 = 2.0$), equal to $UB_{ISV} + UB_{ITS}$.}:

\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:pm}
	PM(t) = LB_{PM} + \frac{(MP_{ISV}(t) + MP_{ITS}(t)) \cdot (UB_{PM} - LB_{PM})}{UB_{ISV} + UB_{ITS}} \nonumber \\ \in [LB_{PM},UB_{PM}]
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Customer-Specific Formulas}\label{ch:sfd:csf}
% ****************************************************************************************************

In the following the customer-specific formulas are discussed. Based on the two \acp{CLD} developed in Chapter \ref{ch:cld}, i.e. generic \ac{PaaS} customer segment (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_cs}) and \ac{PaaS} customer segment interdependencies (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}), now the unique \acp{CVP} for all five customer segments are developed.

As indicated in Figure \ref{fig:cld_cs}, the \ac{CVP} for each customer segment is influenced by six variables. The four variables governance model (cf. Formula \ref{eq:gov}), technical scope (cf. Formula \ref{eq:ts}), additional services (cf. Formula \ref{eq:as}), as well as platform improvements (cf. Formula \ref{eq:pi}) are common contributing factors and thus are included in all five corresponding \ac{CVP} functions (cf. Formulas \ref{eq:cvp:isv} - \ref{eq:cvp:pc}). Moreover, the \acp{CVP} are further influenced by certain customer segments (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}), however these influences are different for each customer segment, as explained further below. And finally, the core value proposition, i.e. distribution channel, application-based integration, development, and integration, influences the \acp{CVP} as noted in the discussion of the 23 explorative case studies. Due to missing data and for reasons of intelligibility, the core value proposition is omitted in this first version of the quantitative model. Adding this factor to the simulation model would entail at least 20 new external variables\footnote{The impact of the four different core value propositions needs to be modeled for all five customer segments, resulting in at least $4 \cdot 5 = 20$ additional external model variables.}, which would raise the complexity of the model dramatically.

The \ac{CVP} for complementors, i.e. \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups, is composed of the four general variables $GOV(t_0)$, $TS(t)$, $AS(t)$, and $PI(t)$, the initial \ac{CVP}, i.e. $CVP_{ISV}(t_0)$ or $ CVP_{ITS}(t_0)$, as well as by the market penetration of the application ($MP_{AC}(t)$) and platform customers ($MP_{PC}(t)$):

\begin{align}
		CVP_{ISV}(t) &= CVP_{ISV}(t_0) \cdot GOV(t) \cdot TS(t) \cdot AS(t) \cdot \nonumber \\ &\qquad PI(t) \cdot MP_{AC}(t) \cdot MP_{PC}(t),\label{eq:cvp:isv}\\
		CVP_{ITS}(t) &= CVP_{ITS}(t_0) \cdot GOV(t) \cdot TS(t) \cdot AS(t) \cdot \nonumber \\ &\qquad PI(t) \cdot MP_{AC}(t) \cdot MP_{PC}(t)\label{eq:cvp:its}
\end{align}

As with the two customer segments discussed previously, the \ac{SI} \ac{CVP} is also influenced by the four general variables $GOV(t_0)$, $TS(t)$, $AS(t)$, and $PI(t)$ as well as by the initial \ac{CVP} ($CVP_{SI}(t_0)$). Due to the fact that \acp{SI} offer consultancy services especially for the two customer segments application customers and platform customers, the \ac{SI} \ac{CVP} is influenced by these two corresponding market penetration values: $MP_{AC}(t)$ and $MP_{PC}(t)$. Moreover, the number of platform modules ($PM(t)$) is an indicator of a flourishing platform and therefore influences the \ac{SI} \ac{CVP}:

\begin{align}
		CVP_{SI}(t) &= CVP_{SI}(t_0) \cdot GOV(t) \cdot TS(t) \cdot AS(t) \cdot \nonumber \\ &\qquad PI(t) \cdot PM(t) \cdot MP_{AC}(t) \cdot MP_{PC}(t)\label{eq:cvp:si}
\end{align}

The remaining two customer segments, viz. application and platform customers, are also influenced by the four general variables $GOV(t_0)$, $TS(t)$, $AS(t)$, and $PI(t)$ as well as by the initial \ac{CVP} ($CVP_{AC}(t_0)$ or\linebreak $CVP_{PC}(t_0)$). In accordance with the \ac{CVP} for \acp{SI}, the number of \acp{SI} offering consultancy services for a certain platform ($MP_{SI}(t)$) positively affects both the corresponding target customer segment \acp{CVP}, i.e. application ($CVP_{AC}(t)$) as well as platform customers ($CVP_{PC}(t)$). Moreover, the number of available platform modules ($PM(t)$) is quite important for these two customer segments and thus this figure influences these \acp{CVP} accordingly:

\begin{align}
		CVP_{AC}(t) &= CVP_{AC}(t_0) \cdot GOV(t) \cdot TS(t) \cdot AS(t) \cdot \nonumber \\ &\qquad PI(t) \cdot PM(t) \cdot MP_{SI}(t),\label{eq:cvp:ac}\\
		CVP_ {PC}(t) &= CVP_{PC}(t_0) \cdot GOV(t) \cdot TS(t) \cdot AS(t) \cdot \nonumber \\ &\qquad PI(t) \cdot PM(t) \cdot MP_{SI}(t)\label{eq:cvp:pc}
\end{align}

In what follows, the remaining customer-specific formulas are introduced. Since these functions are consistent for all five customer segments, the generic notation $CS$ is used in the following and denotes the generic character of these functions. However, in Appendix \ref{ch:app04} all simulation functions are summarized including the specific functions for all five customer segments (cf. Appendix \ref{ch:app04:csf}).

As written above, each customer segment is modeled with two stocks: potential <customer segment> and <customer segment> population. First, the initial magnitude ($\mathit{Potential~CS(t_0)}$) of the potential customer stock \linebreak ($\mathit{Potential~CS(t)}$) decreases in virtue of the corresponding adoption rate \linebreak ($AR_{CS}(t)$, cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:ar}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:pot}
	\mathit{Potential~CS(t)} =\mathit{Potential~CS(t_0)} - \int\limits_{t_0}^t  [AR_{CS}(s)]ds
\end{equation}

The corresponding population stock ($\mathit{Population~CS(t)}$) grows beyond its initial stock size ($\mathit{Population~CS(t_0)}$) through the corresponding adoption rate ($AR_{CS}(t)$, cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:ar}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:pop}
	\mathit{Population~CS(t)} = \int\limits_{t_0}^t [AR_{CS}(s)]ds + \mathit{Population~CS(t_0)}
\end{equation}

In this work, three different adopter groups have been identified. Thus the adoption rate ($AR_{CS}(t)$) is the sum of the variables innovators ($IN_{CS}(t)$, cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:in}), imitators ($IM_{CS}(t)$, cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:im}), and adoption from the customer value proposition ($ACVP_{CS}(t)$, cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:acvp}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:ar}
		AR_{CS}(t) = IN_{CS}(t) + IM_{CS}(t) + ACVP_{CS}(t)	
\end{equation}

The ratio of how many customers of a specific customer segment are using the platform is required for a few calculations below. For this purpose, the current customers ($\mathit{Population~CS(t)}$) are divided by the overall size of the customer segment ($\mathit{Population~CS(t)} + \mathit{Potential~CS(t)})$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:ratio}
		RATIO_{CS}(t) = \frac{\mathit{Population~CS(t)}}{\mathit{Population~CS(t)} + \mathit{Potential~CS(t)}} \in [0.0,1.0]
\end{equation}

By using this ratio, which actually represents the plain market penetration in the interval $[0.0,1.0]$, the desired market penetration can be calculated by applying Formula \ref{eq:lts} and mapping $RATIO_{CS}(t)$ onto the desired interval:

\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:cs:mp}
	MP_{CS}(t) = LB_{MP_{CS}} + RATIO_{CS}(t) \cdot (UB_{MP_{CS}} - LB_{MP_{CS}})  \nonumber \\ \in [LB_{MP_{CS}},UB_{MP_{CS}}]
\end{eqnarray}

The remaining three adopter groups are calculated as follows: Innovators are simply determined by the product of the probability of innovators ($P_{IN_{CS}}$) and the corresponding potential customer stock size \linebreak ($\mathit{Potential~CS(t)}$):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:in}
		IN_{CS}(t) = \mathit{Potential~CS(t)} \cdot P_{IN_{CS}}
\end{equation}

In order to calculate the variable imitators, the probability of imitators ($P_{IM_{CS}}$) is multiplied by the corresponding customer segment ratio ($RATIO_{CS}(t)$). This intermediate result is then further multiplied by the potential customer stock size ($\mathit{Potential~CS(t)}$). By including the variavle $RATIO_{CS}(t)$ in the imitator calculation, this function yields the desired s-shaped curve. Basically, the variable $RATIO_{CS}(t)$ increases and the variable $\mathit{Potential~CS(t)}$ decreases all the time, thus providing the s-shaped curve:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:im}
		IM_{CS}(t) = \mathit{Potential~CS(t)} \cdot P_{IM_{CS}} \cdot RATIO_{CS}(t)
\end{equation}

And finally the adoption from the customer value proposition \linebreak ($ACVP_{CS}(t)$) is similar to the imitator function, i.e. consists in the product of the potential customers ($\mathit{Potential~CS(t)}$), the customer segment ratio ($RATIO_{CS}(t)$), and the corresponding customer segment \ac{CVP} ($CVP_{CS}(t)$, cf. Formulas \ref{eq:cvp:isv} - \ref{eq:cvp:pc}). Also, this function, like Formula \ref{eq:cs:im} yields an s-shaped curve:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cs:acvp}
		ACVP_{CS}(t) = \mathit{Potential~CS(t)} \cdot CVP_{CS}(t) \cdot RATIO_{CS}(t)
\end{equation}

\section{Model Variables}\label{ch:sfd:mv}
% ****************************************************************************************************

In order to simulate the \ac{PaaS} business model adoption using the model foundations introduced above and the customer-specific formulas, 18\linebreak model variables need to be defined before the simulation can be run. These 18 model variables and their corresponding intervals are presented in Table \ref{tab:mvar}. The variables themselves have been derived directly from the simulation model (\ac{SFD}) in combination with the \ac{CLD} upon which the \ac{SFD} is built. In contrast, the corresponding intervals have been defined by analyzing the model characteristics, especially the mathematical foundations and its properties, and the correlations among the above defined formulas. This analysis resulted in the intervals presented here and was reviewed as well as adjusted by several experts. In the following all variables and their intervals are briefly discussed.

In the first column of Table \ref{tab:mvar}, three important model variables are illustrated. First, the \ac{PaaS} platforms differ noticeably with respect to their chosen governance model, which needs to be taken into account in the simulation. While a qualitative ordinal scale was chosen in the classification scheme, a quantitative scale is required in the case of the simulation model. Therefore, the governance model variable can attain values in the interval $[0.0,1.0]$, where values near $0$ represent a strictly limited governance model, and values near $1$ an open governance model. The next two variables, viz. technical scope and additional services, are further essential factors in the \ac{PaaS} adoption process. Also, these two variables can attain values in the interval $[0.0,1.0]$, where values near $0$ represent next to no technical capabilities or no additional services, and values near $1$ extensive technical capabilities or various additional services. The value of $0$ for any of these three variables should be carefully selected and its consequences considered. Since these variables are used multiplicatively in the calculation of the \acp{CVP} (cf. Formulas \ref{eq:cvp:isv} - \ref{eq:cvp:pc}), a value of $0$ always leads to a \ac{CVP} of $0$. Consequently, not a single customer would be convinced by the \ac{CVP} since this value is also used multiplicatively (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:acvp}).

As discussed in Subsection \ref{ch:tf:bmc} and Section \ref{ch:cld:cs}, each customer segment receives its own unique \ac{CVP}, as highlighted by \citet{Johnson2008}. Hence, for all five customer segments the initial \ac{CVP} needs to be defined. These five model variables are illustrated in the second column of Table \ref{tab:mvar}. Based on the characteristics of this model, reasonable values for the initial \acp{CVP} lie in the interval $[0.0,0.1]$. Values near $0$ denote a nonexisting \ac{CVP}, and values close to $0.1$ a superior \ac{CVP}. Again, the value $0$ should be carefully considered, due to its substantial impact. This value will literally lead to the case of not a single customer of the corresponding customer segment starting to use the platform based on the \ac{CVP}.

The remaining ten model variables are used to model the adoption diffusion, especially in the beginning of the adoption process. In accordance with \citet[p. 19]{Sterman2001}, the probability of imitators needs to be defined independently for all five customer segments, as illustrated in the fourth column of Table \ref{tab:mvar}. These adopters start using the platform based on same-sided network effects as calculated in Formula \ref{eq:cs:im}. Values for the probability of imitators for all customer segments typically lie in the interval $[0.0, 0.05]$. Due to the fact that these values remain constant for the whole simulation, these intervals are rather small and lie at the bottom of the scale so as to avoid adoption rates that are unrealistic or too high and by association an overly fast adoption of the platform. As mentioned for the model variables introduced above, the value $0$ should be carefully considered here as well. Here, this value basically means that there are no imitators for the corresponding customer segment.

Finally, also the probability of innovators needs to be defined for all five customer segments, as illustrated in the third column of Table \ref{tab:mvar}. For these probabilities, an even smaller interval at the bottom of the scale was chosen: $[0.0,0.025]$. This small interval was selected due to the fact that this adopter group is simply calculated by using the corresponding innovator probability and the corresponding potential customers, as shown in Formula \ref{eq:cs:in}. Moreover, the calculation of imitators (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:im}) as well as the adoption from customer value proposition (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:acvp}) can result in the value $0$, in which case the corresponding customer segment ratio (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cs:ratio}) is also zero. In other words, the adoption from these two adopter groups is nonexistent in the scenario just described. Therefore, the values for the probability of innovators should to be greater than $0$, since this adopter group is calculated without the customer segment ratio, and for probabilities greater than $0$ yields values greater than $0$ (representing innovators), as shown in Formula \ref{eq:cs:in}. In case a probability of $0$ is selected for a customer segment, this segment would be non-existent in this simulation -- in other words, the population of this customer segment would remain empty. Basically, the adoption process always starts with this adopter group, i.e. the innovators, giving rise to the guidelines described above.

In addition to the 18 model variables introduced previously, 20 further model parameters are established (to be exact ten intervals and consequently ten lower as well as ten upper boundaries). This makes it possible to provide the possibility to adjust the model dynamics. By altering these parameters, the impact of certain model variables, but also the extent of specific network effects, will change according to the modifications. Just like the model variables, the model parameters were also derived directly from the \ac{SFD} and the simulation model. In Table \ref{tab:mpara} the proposed ten intervals and the resulting 20 parameters are illustrated. Moreover, these initially suggested intervals were also discussed and evaluated iteratively in conformity with the \ac{DSR} design cycle \citep{Hevner2007}. In the following these model parameters and their corresponding intervals as well as their basic impact are discussed.

Platform improvements (cf. Formula \ref{eq:pi}) have been shown to enhance the \acp{CVP} (cf. Formulas \ref{eq:cvp:isv} - \ref{eq:cvp:pc}), the technical scope (cf. Formula \ref{eq:ts}), as well as the additional services (cf. Formula \ref{eq:as}) over time. In order to manage the impact of the platform improvements on these three variables, the platform improvements interval was chosen correspondingly. The interval $[1.0,2.0]$ is suggested for the first version of this simulation model, where the lower boundary with the value $1.0$ represents the case of no improvements at all and the upper boundary with the value $2.0$ the case of an improvement of $100\%$. Due to the fact that the variable platform improvements is used multiplicatively, this approach is suitable. Obviously, this interval, but clearly the other nine intervals as well, can be adjusted so as to take specific characteristics of the examined object into account. For instance, by setting the lower boundary below $1$, the variable platform improvements can also affect the other factors negatively. Further, the overall impact of the variable platform improvements can also be decreased or increased by decreasing or increasing the upper boundary for platform improvements.

Another important component of the model is the variable platform modules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}. This factor influences the \acp{CVP} of application customers (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:ac}) and platform customers (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:pc}) as well as \acp{SI} (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:si}). As shown in Formula \ref{eq:pm}, for reasons of simplicity, the variable platform modules is calculated using the market penetrations of \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups, i.e. complementors, and simply mapping it onto the platform module interval $[1.0,2.0]$. Based on this admittedly quite simple calculation, the value of $1$ in this interval represents the case of no platform modules at all, and the value $2$ indicates various platform modules. Also the variable platform modules is used multiplicatively and therefore this interpretation holds good. Setting the lower boundary below $1$ would mean that in the case of no platform modules, the relevant \acp{CVP} are affected negatively. Just like the platform improvements, the overall impact of the variable platform modules can be adjusted by changing the corresponding upper boundary.

The next three factors in Table \ref{tab:mpara}, i.e. governance, technical scope, and additional services, affect the \acp{CVP} of all five customer segments (cf. Formulas \ref{eq:cvp:isv} - \ref{eq:cvp:pc}), as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cld_bp}. Due to missing data concerning customer preferences etc., initially the same interval of $[1.0,1.1]$ is suggested for these three model parameters. The lower boundary of $1$ represents no alternation of the dependent factor and the upper boundary of $1.1$ signifies an improvement of $10\%$ for the dependent factor. Once again, these variables are used multiplicatively and thus this explanation holds good. By changing the lower and upper boundaries the impact of these three model variables can be adjusted as required. Also, here a lower boundary less than $1$ would lead to a negative influence.

The remaining five intervals are concerned with managing the market penetration values of all customer segments. As mentioned above, \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups, i.e. complementors, develop and deploy platform modules. Thus, their market penetration values are used for the platform modules calculation (cf. Formula \ref{eq:pm}). Initially the market penetrations of these two customer segments are simply designed to lie in the interval $[0.0,1.0]$. Actually, this interval represents the outcome of the corresponding ratio calculations (cf. Formulas \ref{eq:cs:ratio}, \ref{eq:isv:ratio}, and \ref{eq:its:ratio}) and hence is not required in this particular case. However, the impact of \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups on the platform modules differs most likely for each object examined. These circumstances can be taken into account by adjusting both intervals accordingly. For instance, by increasing the upper boundary for \acp{ISV} the impact of this customer segment on the variable platform modules will increase compared to the impact of \ac{IT} startups.

The magnitude of the application customer population influences the \acp{CVP} of \acp{ISV} (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:isv}), \ac{IT} startups (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:its}), and \acp{SI} (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:si}) positively. Especially for complementors this influence is rather important and therefore the interval for the application customer market penetration is set to $[1.0,2.0]$. As previously mentioned, by changing this interval the actual impact of the magnitude of the application customer population size in the current simulation can be modeled.

\acp{SI} support the implementation of applications as well as whole systems and therefore the value of the \acp{SI} population affects the \acp{CVP} for application customers (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:ac}) and platform customers (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:pc}) positively. However, this impact is quite small and thus the interval is initially set to $[1.0,1.1]$. And finally, the market penetration of the platform customer segment influences the \acp{CVP} of \acp{ISV} (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:isv}), \ac{IT} startups (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:its}), and \acp{SI} (cf. Formula \ref{eq:cvp:si}) similar to the application customer market penetration. Compared to the interval of the application customer market penetration, a smaller interval was chosen due to the fact that platform customers utilize platform modules in addition to the platform itself, i.e. not in the same was as the customer segment application customers. Hence, the interval for the market penetration of platform customers is initially set to $[1.0,1.5]$.

To sum up, the intervals presented above are suggestions which seem reasonable after evaluating and reviewing them. However, users of this simulation model are highly encouraged to adjust these intervals in order to take the characteristics of the object under examination into account. Among other things, this simulation model is applied to an example in the next chapter in order to show its direct usability.
