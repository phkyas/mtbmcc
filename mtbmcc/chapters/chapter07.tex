%Model Boundary - Organization resp. single PaaS product (not the PaaS market as a whole)

 %The specific impact of the core value proposition onto the <customer segment> customer value proposition depends on the actual <customer segment> and needs to be further investigated for the transformation into a quantified model.

%Also here the specific impact of both variables onto the <customer segment> customer value proposition depends on the actual <customer segment> and needs to be further investigated for the transformation into a quantified model.

%Once again, the specific impact of the variable additional services onto the <customer segment> customer value proposition depends on the actual <customer segment> and needs to be further investigated for the transformation into a quantified model.

% As already mentioned above, the specific impact of the variable platform improvements onto the <customer segment> customer value proposition, additional services, and technical scope depends on the actual <customer segment> and needs to be further investigated for the transformation into a quantified model.

		\item vorerst keine CF (contact frequency) wie bei Sterman, kann im ersten versuch vernachl√§ssig werden
		\item additiv oder multiplikativ
		\item annahme: total population = adopters + potentail adopters
		\item Flow von ITS zu ISV
		\item Tradeoff against the uncertainties inevitably inherent in quantification
		\item How much value does quantified modelling add to qualitative analysis? (Coyle 2000)
		\item How can we guard against models that risk becoming plausible nonsense? (Coyle 2000)
