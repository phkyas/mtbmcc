The goal of this thesis was to facilitate a better understanding of the dynamics of \acf{PaaS} business models and thus to answer the main research question -- \textit{How to design Platform as a Service business models in order to achieve a high adoption rate?} -- as well as its three sub-research questions. In order to address this research project, a \acf{DSR} approach was chosen, resulting in three artifacts which are based on each other and represent the outcomes of the three sub-research questions. First, a classification scheme presenting the main design elements of \ac{PaaS} business models was created in order to answer the first sub-research question -- \textit{How can business models of Platform as a Service business models be classified?} Second, a qualitative system dynamics model -- \acf{CLD} --, illustrating the complex dynamics of \ac{PaaS} business models, was developed based on the second sub-research question -- \textit{How are the identified Platform as a Service business model elements -- especially in regards to the platform adoption -- interrelated?} Third, the qualitative model was further transferred into a quantitative model -- \acf{SFD} -- providing the opportunity to simulate the adoption of \ac{PaaS} business models and answers the third sub-research question -- \textit{How can the revealed relationships between Platform as a Service business model elements be quantified and the platform adoption simulated?} These artifacts together allow a systematic review of \ac{PaaS} business models with special regard to the adoption dynamics and facilitate the business model design process through analysis as well as simulation features. 

All three artifacts were developed using scientific methods in an iterative approach in line with \citet{Hevner2007} and \citet{Peffers2007}. The classification scheme was developed using the classification methodology introduced by \citet{Fettke2003} and is based on 23 explorative case studies according to \citet{Eisenhardt1989} and \citet{Yin2008}. Both system dynamics models -- qualitative and quantitative -- have been developed using the system dynamics theory in line with \citet{Sterman2000,Sterman2001}. These system dynamics models are built upon the adoption cycle concept \citep{Sterman2001} and highlight two main aspects crucial for the adoption of \ac{PaaS} business models. First, each addressed customer segment needs a specific and dedicated \acf{CVP}, based on its individual needs. This aspect is also emphasized by \citet{Johnson2008} in his business model conceptualization which has been used for the 23 case studies. Second, the interdependencies between the identified target customer segments -- cross-sided network effects -- are decisive for the overall platform adoption process.

The results presented in the thesis at hand provide a significant scientific and practical contribution. The three artifacts -- the classification scheme as well as the qualitative and quantitative system dynamics model -- contribute to the knowledge base and facilitate a better understanding of \ac{PaaS} business models. In particular, the \ac{CLD} explaining the inherent dynamics of \ac{PaaS} business models enhances existing rather structural knowledge about \ac{PaaS} business models. While other authors such as \citet{BenLagha2001}, \citet{Klueber2000}, and \citet{Kiani2009} focused on explaining the interrelationships of business model elements and \citet{Cusumano2010}, \citet{Gawer2008}, \citet{Cusumano2002}, \citet{Eisenmann2006}, and \citet{Beimborn2011} focused on general platform strategies, in this thesis both approaches are taken into account on the basis of \ac{PaaS} business models. The system dynamics approach presented in the thesis at hand focuses on and explains the impact of the interdependencies of the previously identified \ac{PaaS} business model design elements (derived from the classification scheme) with respect to the overall platform adoption. Another contribution of the research presented here is the analysis and explanation of the interdependencies among the five revealed target customer segments in multi-sided business models. Moreover, the quantitative model represents a major contribution of the thesis at hand, going one step further as other researchers so far -- for instance \citet{Klueber2000} and \citet{Kiani2009} -- and provides a first attempt to simulate the adoption of \ac{PaaS} business models. Besides providing general system dynamics models explaining the interdependencies within \ac{PaaS} business models and facilitate the simulation of such business models, a \acf{PoC} study examining the platform adoption was performed. The applicability of system dynamics for the analysis of multi-sided \ac{PaaS} business models was illustrated on a concrete example and generalized for practical use.

The presented results provide also a contribution with practical relevance. The knowledge about typical balancing and self-reinforcing feedback loops presented in the generic \ac{CLD} can help \ac{PaaS} providers to understand the adoption dynamics of their platform and which factors have influence on it. Moreover, utilizing the simulation model can support these providers beyond just understanding these dynamics. Potential managerial decisions can be simulated thus evaluating their long run impact on the platform adoption. The evaluation example clearly demonstrates how, based on the identified generic feedback loops, potential week features of existing business models can be identified.

Despite of the promising results, the study has limitations that might affect the generalizability of the results and that need to be mentioned. Even though the classification scheme has been evaluated in 23 case studies, the developed system dynamics models have been evaluated only in several \ac{PoC} studies. This number is sufficient to assure rigor and relevant results, but might limit the generalizability of both system dynamics models.

Within this thesis the design elements as well as feedback structure -- dynamics -- of \ac{PaaS} business models have been exhibited and illustrated in form of a classification scheme and system dynamics models. Further research might include an extensive evaluation of the system dynamics models -- \ac{CLD} and \ac{SFD} -- using various \ac{PoC} studies. Moreover, research projects with respect to the mathematical model foundations -- assumptions, variables, parameters, codomains, and the like -- could yield to specific identifications of high-leverage interventions and policies in the domain of \ac{PaaS} business models. Another aspect which has not been considered within this thesis is the decreasing value of software. Platform modules, especially applications, built upon \ac{PaaS} platforms are rather lightweight solutions with a relatively short lifetime and thus will become less valuable over time. This fact needs to be further investigated and taken into account. Finally, the impact of the influencing factors is -- in this first simulation model -- equal for all customer segments. Further research could investigate the magnitude of these factors and define customer segment specific factors. Thus, the detailed simulation of \ac{PaaS} business models based on the gained knowledge would be interesting further research.
