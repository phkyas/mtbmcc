In order to evaluate and show the applicability of the previous developed \ac{DSR} artifacts -- classification scheme (cf. Chapter \ref{ch:sota}), \ac{CLD} (cf. Chapter \ref{ch:cld}), and \ac{SFD} (cf. Chapter \ref{ch:sfd}) --, in the following a \acf{PoC} study using the example of the SAP HANA Cloud platform is presented. This approach is in conformity with the \ac{DSR} design cycle of \citet[pp. 88,90-91]{Hevner2007} and the \ac{DSR} activity evaluation according to \citet[p. 56]{Peffers2007}, whereby the artifacts have been evaluated against the real world by their reapplication in the context of \ac{PaaS} business models.

\section{Classification}\label{ch:poc:cs}
% ****************************************************************************************************

The business model of the SAP HANA Cloud platform is explained and illustrated, using the business model conceptualization proposed by \citet{Johnson2008}, in detail within Subsection \ref{ch:sota:sap}. In order to classify \ac{PaaS} business models, a corresponding classification scheme have been developed. How the SAP HANA Cloud platform addresses the identified classification criteria is briefly discussed below and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cs:sap} by means of a morphological box, whereas the addressed characteristics are highlighted.

Within the case study analysis of this platform, four diverse stakeholder groups, which are directly targeted, were identified -- application customer, development partners, platform customers, and individual developers. Using the terminology of the classification scheme, the SAP HANA Cloud platform addresses all five identified customer segments -- \ac{IT} startup, \ac{SI}, \ac{ISV}, platform customer, as well as application customer. However, these customer segments are served differently as illustrated further below. SAP HANA Cloud aims to support the development, deployment, and management of standalone as well as integrated cloud solutions. However, the focus of this platform is rather to provide extensive integration features und thus classified as \ac{PaaS} platform with the core value proposition integration. The SAP HANA Cloud platform is neither an open source platform nor a highly regulated platform, hence a partly limited governance model is pursued. Meaning platform users of all characteristics have an extensive freedom of choice, although certain areas are regulated directly by the platform provider. Even though the SAP HANA Cloud platform is offering several technical capabilities, for instance the SAP Hana Cloud Eclipse plugin and corresponding \ac{SDK} (Java), they are considered rather as limited and thus for the criterion technical scope the characteristic limited technical capabilities is selected. In particular, the comparison with other \ac{PaaS} platforms and their technical capabilities support this classification. Based on the SAP HANA Cloud platform case study, three revenue streams, which are used by the platform provider, have been identified. First, platform customers are charged with subscription-based fees ranging from $370$ to $16.000$ \ac{EUR} monthly. Second, SAP takes a revenue share of $15\%$ for platform modules developed by complementors -- \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} -- and distributed over the SAP store. Third, some charged addition services are offered, including annual development partner fees of $1.990$ \ac{EUR} and application certification fees ranging from $495$ to $990$ \ac{EUR}.

As set out above, the classification scheme developed in this thesis can be easily used to initially assess and classify \ac{PaaS} business models and their characteristics. Whereby the classification scheme is aimed to be as user friendly as possible -- a key classification guideline according to \citet[p. 41]{Fettke2003} --, but yet ensuring that the classification criteria as well as their characteristics are comprehensible and sufficient.

\section{Qualitative Findings}\label{ch:poc:qf}
% ****************************************************************************************************

Based on the previous developed \acp{CLD} (cf. Figures \ref{fig:cld_cs} - \ref{fig:cld_bp}) \ac{PaaS} business models and their inherent dynamics can be investigated, finally leading to a better understanding of the impacts of these dynamics.

As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:cld_cs}, six basic factors influencing the \acp{CVP} for all customer segments have been discussed. First, the core value proposition of the SAP HANA Cloud platform which has a direct impact on the \acp{CVP} is, as mentioned above, integration-focused. This focus seems appropriate for all five customer segments: complementors -- \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups -- developing integration-based platform modules, platform customers developing internal integration solutions, application customers using platform modules for integration purposes, and \acp{SI} providing corresponding consultancy services. Second, the partly limited governance model might also positively influence the \acp{CVP} for \acp{ISV}, \ac{IT} startups, and platform customers, although this might not have much influence on \acp{SI} and application customers. Third, the rather limited technical scope (limited technical capabilities) will, in the best case, not strengthen the \acp{CVP} especially for \acp{ISV}, \ac{IT} startups, and platform customers. However, in the worst case this limited technical scope will change to the contrary and negatively influence these \acp{CVP}. Fourth, although some additional services are offered and thus positively influence the \acp{CVP} particularly for \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups, a broader range of additional services dedicated to all targeted customer segments would increase this impact lasting. Fifth, as discussed in Section \ref {ch:cld:cs} and in line with \citet[p. 200]{Evans2003} platform improvements lead to improved \acp{CVP} and also to enlarged technical capabilities as well as a wider range of additional services. Due to the fact the precise quantities of the variables revenue and investments, which result in platform improvements, are unknown, the actual impact of the self-reinforcing feedback loops R\_2, R\_3, and R\_4 associated with platform improvements (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_cs}) are rather cloudy. Sixth, the overall market penetration of the SAP HANA Cloud platform is currently smallish and influences the \acp{CVP} scarcely perceptible. This impact might change with an increase in the customer base leading to an increased overall market penetration as indicated by the self-reinforcing feedback loop R\_5 in Figure \ref{fig:cld_cs}.

Using the generic \ac{PaaS} customer segment \ac{CLD}, \ac{PaaS} business models can be analyzed with regard to the adoption dynamics and first conclusions can be drawn. In case of the SAP HANA Cloud platform the most significant remark so far concerns the technical scope. By individual consideration and even more in comparison with other \ac{PaaS} platforms offering the core value proposition integration, the currently offered technical capabilities are not sufficient. Hence, enlarging the technical scope might lead to substantial \ac{CVP} enhancements.

The inherent and crucial cross-sided network effects between the five \ac{PaaS} customer segments have been discussed in Section \ref{ch:cld:csi} and illustrated by means of a \ac{CLD} (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}). Since the SAP HANA Cloud platform is addressing all five customer segments, this \ac{CLD} cannot be simplified, nevertheless valuable insights can be gained.

Platform modules have been identified to influence -- directly and indirectly -- all customer segments. These platform complements are developed and provided by complementors -- \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups -- and are valuable mainly for platform and application customers but also for \acp{SI}. However, only a few ready to use applications built upon the SAP HANA Cloud platform, which might be used by application customers, are offered at present. Hence, the self-reinforcing feedback loops R\_8 and R\_9 (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}) will only have weak impacts. Since just a few applications (platform modules) are available, the \ac{CVP} for application customers will remain weak and consequently the application customer population will not increase considerable. This implies that due to the few application customers the \acp{CVP} for \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups are not significant improved and thus the number of platform modules stays constant. Furthermore, in order to sell platform modules built upon the SAP HANA Cloud platform via the SAP Store, the so called development partners -- \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups -- are charged literally just to be such a development partner ($1.990$ \ac{EUR} yearly) and in addition these applications need to go through a charged certification process (initial $990$ \ac{EUR} and yearly recurring $495$ \ac{EUR}). All these facts and circumstances taken together lead to the unpleasant, but not unusual, situation in which platform providers face in their early stages the so called chicken and egg launch problem. Since this problem is not unfamiliar, approaches so as to overcome this problem are present. For instance, a typical approach to solve this problem is subsidizing one or more customer segments through incentives as discussed by \citet[pp. 1,5]{Eisenmann2006} and \citet[pp. 195-196]{Evans2003}. The customer segment platform customers on the other hand is also influenced through platform modules, although less strongly because they utilize platform modules in addition to the actually used platform and not solely as the customer segment application customers. Consequently, also the feedback loops R\_10 and R\_11 (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}) connecting the variables platform customers and platform modules remain rather weak due to the manageable number of platform modules. Finally, since the variables platform and application customers as well as platform modules are relatively low, the \ac{CVP} for \acp{SI} is not influenced positively through these factors. As a result the two self-reinforcing feedback loops R\_6 and R\_7 (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_csi}) are almost immaterial.

The application of the developed \ac{CLD} artifact (cf. Figure \ref{fig:cld_bp}) in the real world scenario of the SAP HANA Cloud platform clearly identifies two emphases, where SAP might improve their business model. First, as mentioned above the currently offered technical capabilities are not sufficient and prevent the platform to establish oneself. Extending the technical scope might particularly increase the \acp{CVP} for \acp{ISV}, \ac{IT} startups, and platform customers. Second, so far the SAP HANA Cloud platform does not create significant cross-sided network effects which have been identified to be essential in the platform adoption process. Instead of experiencing a flourishing platform and its network effects, the common chicken and egg launch problem is faced. SAP might work on these cross-sided network effects and try to create and capture more of them in order to overcome this obstacle, for instance by subsidizing quality- or price-sensitive customers.

In Chapter \ref{ch:sfd} the theoretical foundations -- mathematical formulas -- of the \ac{SFD} respectively platform adoption simulation model have been discussed. Moreover, a comprehensive view of all necessary and instanced model formulas is provided in Appendix \ref{ch:app04}. Reviewing and applying this simulation model in the context of \ac{PaaS} business models presupposes adequate simulation software. For this purpose the simulation software package Vensim\footnote{Vensim. Retrieved June 24, 2013, from \url{http://www.vensim.com}} was chosen for the simple reason that here a free, nevertheless powerful, educational version -- Vensim \acs{PLE} (\acl{PLE}) -- and a free of charge model reader version -- Vensim Model Reader -- are offered. Using this tool, the platform adoption simulation model has been basically instantiated by means of the developed formulas. Furthermore, the time boundaries -- rather short time horizon -- and the integration type have been defined as shown in Table \ref{tab:tb}.

In addition to these basic simulation parameters, the actual simulation variables (cf. Section \ref{ch:sfd:mv} and Table \ref{tab:mvar}) of the SAP HANA Cloud platform have been specified. These instantiated variables have been defined based on an adequate analysis of the SAP HANA Cloud business model as well as through expert discussions and are illustrated in Table \ref{tab:mvar:sap}. Based on the partly limited governance model a middle value of $0.6$ for the variable governance model is selected. Since the offered technical capabilities are currently rather limited, the corresponding variable technical scope is set to a low value of $0.2$. Even though some additional services are provided they could be improved and thus a value of $0.4$ for the variable additional services is determined. For the five customer segments the \acp{CVP} variables and probabilities for innovators as well as imitators are set to the following values: Due to the limited technical capabilities and the comparable high start-up costs for \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startup, their \acp{CVP} have been modeled with a value of $0.05$ respectively with a value of $0.04$. Moreover, the innovator and imitator probabilities haven been set for both customer segments to $0.005$ respectively $0.01$. The \ac{CVP} for \acp{SI} is determined with a value of $0.03$, since the overall customer base is still small; however SAP is a large software vendor and thus \acp{SI} are even so interested in offering consultancy services. Probabilities for innovators and imitators have been defined with a value of $0.0125$ respectively $0.025$. All in all, the \ac{CVP} for platform customers is relatively well at present and hence this variable is set to $0.07$. The corresponding probabilities for early adopters -- innovators and imitators -- have been modeled with the same values as for \acp{SI}. Finally, the \ac{CVP} for application customers is defined with a low value of $0.01$, since the number of platform modules is negligible at this juncture. Nevertheless, the probabilities for innovators and imitators are set to $0.01$ respectively $0.02$, since SAP certificated applications built upon SAP HANA Cloud might attract potential application customers. Summarizing, using the platform adoption simulation model developed in Chapter \ref{ch:sfd} in combination with the above described simulation parameters and variables an instantiation of the simulation model has been implemented by applying the simulation software Vensim \acs{PLE}.

In the following the results of this simulation are by the example of the customer segment adoption rates in general discussed. A detailed overview is provided in Appendix \ref{ch:app05} by means of graphs for the most important model parameters as well as for each customer segment individually. Figure \ref{fig:sim:ar} illustrates the adoption rates of all customer segments. The sum of these adoption rates results in the variable new customers as calculated by Formula \ref{eq:nc} and is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:sim:nc}. Since the customer segment platform customers is served with the most sophisticated \ac{CVP}, its adoption rate reaches the peak first and hence the platform customer population increases quite fast and already at an early stage (cf. Figure \ref{fig:sim:pcs}). A bit surprising, the adoption rate of the customer segment \acp{SI} reaches its peak second. The \ac{CVP} for \acp{SI} is comparable rather low, however this \ac{CVP} is influenced among other things by the platform customer market penetration which increases, based on the early and high adoption rate, quite fast. Thereafter the adoption rate of the customer segment \acp{ISV} reaches its peak. This customer segments reaches the highest peak (representing the highest adoption rate in absolute terms), explained by the proper \ac{CVP} and the early and high platform customer adoption rate, since the \ac{CVP} for \acp{ISV} is positively influenced by the market penetration of this customer segment. The adoption rate of the customer segment \ac{IT} startups reaches its peak next. Due to the fact that the \ac{CVP} for this customer segment is a little worse compared to the \ac{ISV} \ac{CVP}, the \ac{IT} startup customer segment reaches its adoption rate peak latter and not that high as the customer segment \acp{ISV}. The lowest and latest adoption rate reaches the customer segment application customers. Reason for this shaped adoption rate are the relatively low \ac{CVP} and the slow growth of the number of available platform modules (cf. Figure \ref{fig:sim:pm}). Since platform modules are developed by complementors -- \acp{ISV} and \ac{IT} startups --, these two customer segments need to growth first and associated the number of platform modules will also increase, nevertheless delayed. To sum up, the adoption simulation of the SAP HANA Cloud platform confirmed the previous revealed insights and emphasized rather weak point quantitatively. The fact that the currently available number of platform modules prevents the SAP HANA Cloud platform to establish oneself and to create the crucial cross-sided network effects is once again revealed and emphasized through the platform adoption simulation. Moreover, the simulation facilitates to visualize (earlier) findings through numbers and more importantly graphical presentations, thereby simplifying the communicability of these results respectively findings.

By applying the simulation model for the SAP HANA Cloud platform the exemplary \ac{PoC} study is concluded. The application of the three \ac{DSR} artifacts using this platform has shown the applicability of these artifacts in the domain of \ac{PaaS} business models. First, using the classification scheme \ac{PaaS} business models can be classified and, for instance, compared with other \ac{PaaS} business models. Thereby first insights concerning the currently pursued business models -- weaknesses but also strengths -- can be identified. Second, by utilizing the developed \acp{CLD} these first insights can be investigated in more detail. Beyond that, further insights may be revealed and will lead, in combination with the first insights, to a better understanding of the investigated business model. Third, by simulating the adoption of the examined \ac{PaaS} platform using the \ac{SFD} respectively simulation model, the so far gained insights can be quantified and further so far unrevealed insights may be found. All in all, the three \ac{DSR} artifacts -- classification scheme, \ac{CLD}, and \ac{SFD} respectively simulation model -- facilitate a better understanding of the investigated \ac{PaaS} business model in general and in particular with regard to the adoption dynamics.
